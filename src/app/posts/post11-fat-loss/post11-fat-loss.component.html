                        The 'hour-glass' waist is the dream of every individual who has taken a liking towards fitness but you can't seem to find the way to lose that stubborn body fat especially over the belly region. Worry no more, we are here to help. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        First of all the idea of losing fat over a particular region of your body doesn't seem to work very well. Spot reduction is a fitness term that claims to lose body fat over a certain area of the body by exercising muscles in that particular area. Spot reduction tends to be a myth that has been around for quite a while and many people have taken a liking to it and failed because of the lack of science in the technique.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Before diving into the science of fat loss it is critical to know how you acquire the body fat that you have been longing to shed so badly? 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        When you are on a caloric surplus diet you are consuming more than you burn. But what are you consuming or burning, it's the energy that you are gaining from your food. When you are not burning the energy, you are converting that energy into glycogen that is stored as fat reserves in your body. The extra energy is stored as triglycerides in the adipose tissue of the body and that is how you gain weight.
                        <br/>

                    <app-sidebar class="col-lg-2"></app-sidebar>
                </div>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 col-sm-12">
            
                        <ul>
    
                            
    
                            <ul>
                                <li><h4>What happens to stored fat when you diet and exercise?</h4></li>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    Now when you are on a calorie deficit you are consuming less than you burn so your body is forced to use up the stored fat in your adipose tissue to provide energy for the workout. But how does this fat escape the body? The research proves that almost 85% of the fat is exhaled as carbon dioxide and the rest is excreted as water and other byproducts through perspiration or urine. 
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>

                                    When a healthy exercise and diet regime is followed your body burns these fatty-acid molecules and renders them useless, the brain triggers the use of these fat cells to account for the energy required for all the hard work you are doing.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>



                                    </p>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li><h4>Benefits of Fat loss.</h4></li>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    The fat cells in your body are the source of all things harmful, these trigger a dysfunctional process in the body known as Adiposopathy.Adiposopathy, in turn, gives way to problems like hormonal imbalances, inflammation, increased cardio-vascular fat, breathing problems, reduced metabolism, and other diseases.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>

                                    Fat loss helps dilute the effects of Adiposopathy and the body flourishes by decreasing the fat cells that eventually contribute to increased baseline metabolism, reduce inflammation, and to keep those squeaky hormones in control.

                                    Fat loss is a slow process but it can be tweaked up by following certain techniques that have helped many people to get lean and healthy.

                                        Why do you think we are drawn to fast-foods such as fries, burgers, and ice cream while maintaining a safe distance from the healthy stuff like broccoli and leafy vegetables? It is because our body is hard-wired to crave for fats, the taste of fats triggers feel-good hormones in your body that forces your body to crave for chocolates, lol. 
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        The trick is to reduce your overall appetite and stay away from such fatty foods.

                                    <p>
                                        How about building some muscle alongside losing fat? While you are there grinding your way towards a leaner self throw in some strength training workout to build muscle and increase the level of testosterone.

                                        Testosterone is an anabolic hormone that helps in breaking down fats quickly.

                                    <br/>

                                    <p>
                                        A calorie deficit is the main aspect of fat loss but be sure not to go overboard and starve yourself. Extreme diet can cause other problems like dehydration, fatigue, joint pain, etc.

                                    <p>
                                        It is scientifically proven that short sessions of yoga and meditation can drastically increase the rate of fat loss and improve metabolism and blood circulation helping in the overall process.

                                        Researchers have found that sleeping 7-8 hours each night correlates with longevity and cardiac health in humans. Sleep is a recurring state in which your body attempts to repair all the harm that you may have caused during the day, it flushes of all the toxins and when you are following proper regime helps in fat loss.

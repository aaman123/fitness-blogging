                    Most of the beginners when they first step into fitness they think what are the protein supplements that I should be taking to get a great physique and then they go madly searching all over the internet, checking websites and seeing online videos and then they are left confused with a lot of choices.
                    In this article, I am going to mention some of the best protein supplements that beginners should be taking to answer to their dietary needs.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    But first, let's answer the question, Are protein supplements really necessary?? And the answer is it depends on your needs and calorie intake. If you have a fast metabolism and can eat sufficient calories and consume a good quantity of quality protein by consuming whole foods like meat, eggs, and vegetables there's no need for you to take protein supplements but there are certain people that cannot complete their calorie requirements because of slow metabolism or digestion issues.So protein supplements can certainly help in situations where dietary needs are to be answered based on hitting that calorie intake.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    We interviewed many dieticians and supplement experts asking what people should look for in their protein if they are spending a lot of money.The first and foremost thing is the amount of amino acids, there are 20 types of amino acids found in protein ranging from lysine to tyrosine and histidine but one should particularly look for leucine and histidine as those are the alpha-amino acids.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Check for sweeteners and preservatives in your protein as many brands tend to add a lot of them, the less the better. You should always opt for pure protein without any fillers.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Look for the amount of protein it provides per scoop, most brands provide between 25 to 30g of protein per scoop. Based on protein content there are two types of protein. Whey Isolate and Whey Concentrate, Isolate provides 90% of pure protein with fewer carbs, lactose and fat whereas concentrate contains carbs and fats alongside protein. Isolate is typically more expensive than concentrate.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Based on types of protein, there are two Whey and Casein. Both types are made from milk and are generally the byproducts of Cheese Production. Whey is a fast-digesting protein typically preferred during or after workouts because of its fast absorption whereas Casein is a slow-digesting protein that is preferred mostly before bed because of its slow absorption.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Now the question is which is good for beginners, Whey or Casein? And the answer is Whey because it is rich in leucine which is the single most amino acid necessary to jumpstart the process of muscle generation whereas Casein contains high levels of histidine and methionine. But certain people tend to like both so we will be listing the best brands available for whey and casein.

                        As we all know protein is the single nutrient that aids the most in muscle building. Protein is made up of amino acids that aid in the repair and growth of torn out muscles. When you exercise, you create tiny cracks in the muscle fibers which when supplemented with protein helps it grow by repairing and eventually making it bigger.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        But there are so many brands of protein supplements available in the market. Let's see which are the best and why.

                            Faster digesting protein is desirable immediately before and after exercise to help refuel recovering muscles, but slow digestion and absorption may be more beneficial at other times including bedtime when your body typically goes for hours without food. Casein products are acid sensitive and thicken in the stomach. Compared to some other proteins, it can take longer for our Gold Standard 100% Casein to be broken down into its amino acid subcomponents. By using only premium micellar casein as a protein source, we've created a formula that sets the standard for slow digesting protein support. 24g of Micellar Casein

                            Pilates is a word associated with its inventor Joseph Pilates who invented this technique in the early 20th century and is famous all over the world with its dominance in western countries. Certain myths revolve around pilates which is that only people indulged in hardcore fitness and athletic can only practice the technique but the truth every person whether old or young can take the most out of this exercise technique and build a proper physique.

                                Pilates comes in two categories that can be broadly categorized as mat classes and reformer classes. A mat class looks exactly like a yoga class with pilates movement stuffed right into your routine. A mat class includes exercises that are practiced against gravity to strengthen your muscles and core whereas a reformer class makes use of springs and bands but the ultimate goal is muscle and core strengthening.

                                Regardless of what class you choose, make sure to let your instructor know you’re a beginner. This way, they'll be able to keep an eye on you throughout the class and offer modifications or form adjustments.

                            Pilates can be practiced by everyone but if you are old age and have some medical conditions make sure you have a checkup with your doctor to indulge in such movements. Pregnant women should consult a doctor before trying these workouts as it will exert a certain amount of pressure on your belly and core. Children should practice under the guidance of an instructor so that they would not hurt themselves by any wrong movements.

                            So far so, pilates can be practiced by everyone as it promotes optimal growth not physically but also mentally.

                        <li><h4>Muscles involved in Pilates.</h4></li>
                        <br/>
    
                       
                        <p>
                            Pilates is not restricted to specific body parts. Yes, Pilates movements focus on your core and trunk, but that doesn't just mean your abs. Although Pilates is specifically defined as an exercise for the core or abdominal muscles, people must know that the core includes the entire trunk, which is the abdominals, the hips, the inner and outer thighs, and the back. So expect a workout that works your entire body.

                            Dedicating your entire focus to even the smallest movements means that you’ll work the muscles that each exercise intends. And that means you can be dealing with soreness after your workout.

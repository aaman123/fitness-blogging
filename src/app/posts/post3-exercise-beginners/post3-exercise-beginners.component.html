                    So you walk into a gym and there are these buff dudes lifting heavy weights and screaming, pretty intimidating right. So you go into a corner, the most secluded place in the gym and start lifting those 5-10 pounders and all of a sudden a gym whack comes up and starts giving you advice about what exercises you must be doing to achieve that godly physique.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Every gym beginner goes through stuff like this or it's just pretty relatable to me. You are confused with all the opinions and advice people are throwing your way in the gym and you are just standing there all awkward doing nothing but watching those buff dudes lifting heavyweights.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    So here's a guide for what all exercises you need to be doing if you are just starting out your fitness journey.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Let's take it step by step, so it's your first day or week in the gym and assumed that you have not lifted any weights before or haven't done any bodyweight exercises in the past, your body is not accustomed to such exercises so first you need to give it some time to adapt to what you are starting out with. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    The human body is one wonderful machine it will adapt to anything you throw at it, just give it some time and see what wonders it will do for you.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Start out with some stretching and bodyweight exercises like pushups, situps, and pullups and if you are not able to even do the ups there are some alternatives that you can practice to reach there.

                <ul>
                    <li><h4>Compound or Isolation exercises, which is better??</h4></li>
                    <br/>

                    <p>
                        Compound exercises are those that hit more than one muscle group in one full range of motion( contraction and relaxation).
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Isolation exercises are those that hit only one muscle during one full range of motion.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
    
                        When starting out you should always opt for compound exercises as they are the best to boost testosterone levels in your body and kickstart muscle growth. So let's list some of the best compound exercises for beginners.

                <ul>
                    <h4>Upper Body Movements</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h2>Lat Pulldowns and Pullups</h2></li>
                        <div class="img-back">
                            <img class="img-back-1" data-lazy="../../../assets/img/latpull.jpg" alt="lat-pulldowns" />
                            <img class="img-back-2" data-lazy="../../../assets/img/pullups.jpg" alt="lat-pulldowns" />
                        </div>
                        
                   <br/>
                    <p>
                        The Latissimus dorsi or the 'lats' or 'wings' are one of the biggest muscle in your back. Lat pulldowns is the best exercise to hit those muscles as it not only works the lats but also the biceps and forearms.Once large enough the lats are responsible for the body's V-taper, which most of the men dream for.
                    </p>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h2>Barbell BenchPress and Pushups</h2></li>
                        <div class="img-back">
                            <img class="img-back-1" data-lazy="../../../assets/img/incline-bench-press.jpg" alt="becnh-press" />
                            <img class="img-back-2" data-lazy="../../../assets/img/pushups.jpg" alt="pushups"/>
                        </div>
                        <br/>
                        <p>The Pectoralis Major or the 'pecs' are the major muscles that make up the chest.Barbell benchpress is an upper body pressing drill that builds up strength specifically in the chest,triceps and the shoulders.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Abdominal or Mid-body movements</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <ul>
                        <p>The mid-section of the body which comprises of the abs,obliques and the lower back also called as the core of the body is the major muscle group that works as the stabilizers for the whole body. With a strong core you can lift heavyass weights and do whichever workout you want. Its the muscle group that provides superhuman strength to your entire body. So how do you build a strong core, focus on exercises that target the whole body and work those abs.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <li><h2>Plank and Leg raises</h2></li>
                        <div class="img-back">
                            <img class="img-back-1" data-lazy="../../../assets/img/plank.jpg" alt="plank" />
                            <img class="img-back-2" data-lazy="../../../assets/img/leg-raises.jpg" alt="leg-raises" />
                        </div>
                        <br/>
                        <p>The plank is a isometric bodyweight exercise that requires you to hold a position similar to a pushup for a maximum amount of time.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Lower Body Movements</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h2>Squats and Lunges</h2></li>
                        <div class="img-back">
                            <img class="img-back-1" data-lazy="../../../assets/img/squat.jpg"  alt="squats and lunges" />
                            <img class="img-back-2" data-lazy="../../../assets/img/lunges.jpg" alt="squats and lunges" />
                        </div>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Squat known as the king of all exercises is versalite exercise for developing strength in your legs.Squat targets multiple muscles in your legs such as the quadriceps, glutes and the core.Squat is known as a highly functional exercise providing overall strength and agility to the body.</p>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Full Body Movements</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h2>The Deadlift</h2></li>
                        <div class="img-back">
                            <img class="img-back-1" data-lazy="../../../assets/img/deadlift.jpg" alt="deadlift"/>
                        </div>
                        <br/>
                        <p>And here comes my favourite exercise, the Deadlift.The dealift is the singlemost exercise that works most of the muscles in the body ranging from hamstrings, glutes, lower back, forearms, traps... .When it comes to deadlift, the thing that matters the most is the form and correct body posture. Start out slowly with light weights and soon you will be smashing heavy weights to your gym floor.</p>

                        <li><h2>Clean and Jerk(Snatch)</h2></li>
                        <div class="img-back">
                            <img class="img-back-1" data-lazy="../../../assets/img/cleanjerk.jpg" alt="snatch" />
                        </div>
                        <br/>
                        <p>If you are familiar with olympic weightlifting, you might know this awesome exercise. Mostly targeted by intermediate and advanced athletes the snatch is the singlemost exercise with the longest range of motion starting from a dealift position to an overhead squat.</p>
                    </ul>

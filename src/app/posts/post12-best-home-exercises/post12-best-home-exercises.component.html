                    <p>
                        The pushup is the most popular bodyweight exercise that comes into mind when thinking of exercising at home. Being a functional bodyweight movement, pushups are extremely efficient to increase strength in your arms and upper body as it not only targets the pectoral muscles but also the triceps and deltoids leveraging strength benefits to the whole of the upper body.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        There are many variations of pushups that you can try to make the movement even more challenging such as the Bomber pushups, One-Hand pushups, explosive pushups, and so on. Try to isolate the chest and triceps by performing the movement slowly with an increased Time-Under-Tension(TUT) after every repetition to get the most out of the movement.

                        The pullup is considered one of the most challenging exercises as it demands a lot of strength to pull the whole body up using the strength in your arms and back. You will require a significant amount of time to develop the strength to perform a full-pullup that targets your lats and trapezius. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        If you are struggling with an overhand wide-grip pullup you can start with a chin-up that is considered considerably easy than a pullup and it will also help in developing strength in your arms to master the movement.

                    <li><h4>Plank.</h4></li>

                        The plank is an isometric core exercise meaning there is a static contraction of a muscle without any visible movement in the angle of the joint. The plank strengthens the muscles in your lovely abdominals, back, and deltoids.  If executed correctly the plank can help increase the strength of your core and provide correction to an improper body posture.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        There are many variations of a plank to target different muscles in your core such as the side-star plank targets your obliques and the reverse plank targets your delts and erects your spine helping with straightening your erector muscles in your lower spine.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Body-parts engaged - Abdominals, Lats, Shoulders, Core, Lower back.

                <ul>
                    <li><h4>Hip Thrusts</h4></li>
                    <br/>

                    <p>
                        
                        Hip thrusts involve squeezing your glutes and lifting it upwards to the ceiling engaging glute extension working the lower back and your hips.This exercise is most popular among females who crave for a big booty but has diverse results for either gender.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> 

                        Try adding normal weights like a mattress to make the exercise even more challenging and fun.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        An alternate to Hip thrusts is the glute bridge which might look the same but involves an extra extension of the glutes. The Glute-bridge is typically done with shoulders on the floor whereas the Hip-thrusts as done by supporting the shoulders on a platform or a bench.

                        Body-parts engaged - Glutes, Hamstrings, Core, Lower back, Abdominals, Obliques, and Hip flexors

                <ul>
                    <li><h4>BodyWeight squats.</h4></li>
                    <br/>

                    <p>
                        
                        Now let's move on to the lower body and most powerful muscle in your body, the Legs. The legs contain many muscles such as quadriceps, Hamstrings, Glutes, Hip Abductors and it takes a varied range of exercise to target all the muscles but the squat claims to exercise most of these muscles and as to my understanding over the last 5 years the claim holds, haha.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        You can make the exercise more efficient by adding some weights and if you don't have weights at home just try finding a bag and fill it with stuff like books or bottles. Squats are highly functional as they tend to develop strength and exert pressure on your whole body.

                        Body-parts engaged - Quads, Glutes, Hamstrings, Calves, Core.

                    <li><h4>Burpees - Full body movement.</h4></li>
                    <br/>

                    <p>
                        
                        And now to one of my favorite exercises, the Burpee. The Burpee is a full-body movement where you start in a standing position with shoulders and arms extended downwards. Flex your hip and move into a squat position with your hands on the ground. Shift your weights on the hands and fall back to the normal standing position with a slight jump of the ground.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Burpees if executed correctly can help to develop strength and can serve as an aerobic exercise to shed fat and build muscle. As it involves a lot of explosiveness and strength it is categorized under both cardio and resistance training.
                        <br/>

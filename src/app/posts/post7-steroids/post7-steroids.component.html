                Anabolic steroids are performance-enhancing drugs that are chemical variations of dominant male hormone - testosterone. There has always been a nasty debate over the use of steroids while some countries have banned the drugs and can only be taken under a doctor's prescription, some other countries like India have no regulations act for the use of these drugs.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                People who use steroids mostly include professional bodybuilders, athletes, weightlifters, and sprinters. Although there is an established agency ( WADA - World Anti-doping agency )created to control the use of steroids in sports, it is mostly regulated by the federation that is in charge of the particular sport. For example, the International Olympic Committee has strict rules for the use of performance-enhancing drugs and an athlete caught misusing the drug can be sentenced and banned from the sport whereas other federations like the IFBB( International Federation for bodybuilding )allow the use of oral and intravenous drugs.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                Let us see what are the different types of anabolic steroids, how are they used and what are the side-effects that are related to the use of these drugs.

                    <br/>

                    <p>
                        The main hormone that all of these steroids revolve around is testosterone - an anabolic androgenic hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics such as facial hair, deepened voice, muscle, and bone mass. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Let's break the term anabolic androgenic hormone. Anabolic or anabolism refers to build something up( typically muscle ) from smaller units ( protein complex )with the expense of energy and androgenic refers to natural androgens like testosterone that bind with androgenic receptors in the cell to give way to anabolic process.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        All the steroids that you see in the market are slight variations of testosterone known as esters, they are synthetic meaning created artificially that mimics the role of testosterone in the body.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Different types of steroids according to use and popularity include:

                                <li style="list-style-type:disc"><p>    Oxymetholone or Anadrol( considered to be the safest. )</p></li>

                    <p>
                        There are many other kinds of steroids that can be taken orally, applied directly to the skin the form of creams and gel or injected directly into the bloodstream, most people prefer injections as they directly bind with underlying receptors contrary to be taken orally because when taken orally it can be reduced during the digestion process and affect the kidneys and the liver.

                            When it comes to using steroids, many methods are available that can produce optimal results, these methods have been invented and used over the years to create substance abuse more beneficial.
                            Some of the most popular methods include cycling, stacking, pyramiding, certain athletes use a combination of two or three methods based on their needs.

                                I have come across many pros who do steroid cycling with alternate ON and OFF periods over the course of a year or two. The cycling phase initiates by taking one or two steroids for 4-8 weeks and then stopping for 4 weeks to get the body to rest and then starting again for a predetermined amount of time, this completes one cycle.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This method is used in conjunction with cycling and pyramiding and involves the use of more than one steroid. There is a popular belief among athletes that using more than two different kinds of steroids increases the effectiveness of each.

                                This method is also used in conjunction with cycling and involves starting with low doses of the drug and then reaching a maximum and then descending to minimal levels.

                        <p>
                            Substance abuse is a real thing and the use of these drugs can be addictive if used without the proper guidance of a doctor. When it comes to steroids the side-effects weigh down the benefits by a much higher margin. Some of the most common side-effects that steroids can have in both men and women are listed below.
                        </p>

                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p>Permanent loss of hair( androgenetic alopecia ) or excessive growth of hair on the body.

                            Although the side-effects of steroids are life-threatening some individuals are quite resistant to the fact and end up using anabolic drugs without the proper guidance that can lead to major health issues and if you have made up your mind for using steroids please exercise it under proper guidance.

                        <p> Although the use of anabolic steroids is the most prevalent in professional bodybuilding, it is not necessary if your goal is inclined towards fitness, you see fitness and use of steroids are not related and never will be because these drugs carry with them severe side-effects that are just not worth your life and if a professional bodybuilder is claiming that he is all-natural and natty chances are that he/she might be lying as most of the people who compete in the show are juiced up to their gills.</p>
